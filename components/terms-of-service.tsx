            <p>
              We offer a set of technology-enabled services that may include investment opportunity listings, research and analysis, portfolio reporting, transaction facilitation, custody interfaces and investor communications. Specific Services and features may be subject to additional agreements, subscription terms, or offering documents.

            <p>
              We may modify, suspend or discontinue parts of the Services at any time for operational, regulatory or business reasons. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Users of material changes.

            <p>
              To use certain Services, you must create an account and provide accurate, complete and current information. You warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years old and have authority to enter these Terms on behalf of any entity you represent. Certain investments may be available only to accredited or otherwise qualified investors as defined by applicable law.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">4. Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML)</h2>
            <p>
              To comply with our legal obligations (including AML, sanctions and tax reporting), you agree to promptly provide requested identity, entity and financial information, documentation for beneficial owners, and to cooperate with ongoing due diligence. We employ third-party vendors to perform identity verification, sanctions/PEP screening and other compliance checks.
            </p>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to refuse service, restrict activity, or terminate accounts where we reasonably suspect fraudulent activity, sanctions exposure, or failure to provide required documentation. These measures are necessary to satisfy applicable regulatory obligations (e.g., U.S. customer due diligence rules and FinCEN guidance).

              Investments involve risk — including total loss of principal, lack of liquidity, and market volatility.

We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness or timeliness of any information.

              THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
